# Introduction to Data Science

### Starting with a story
Imagine you are a customer that goes to shop at this clothes store which is owned by a buisness. The company collects ***data*** about your purchases, your age, many other things that they use in order to get a better grasp of how well they are operating. This data is processed by specialists in order to reach conclusions to improve their buisness model. A ***data team*** or ***big data team*** process the data. From their conclusions a ***buisness intelligence team*** will produce a buisness insights dashboard. The ***data science team*** uses ***buisness or data analtics*** to predict future behaviour. 

To the untrained eye, this will not make a lot of sense as there is some data sceince jargon that can be cleared up. The buzz words used to explain these areas of research is changing becasue of the evolution in the data science industry. A data scientist 25 years ago would have been called a Statistician but due to all the new and sophisticated technology advancements the titles of these jobs have changed. 

### Distinguishing concepts
#### Analysis vs Analytics
Consider you have a dataset of various types. Dealing with the dataset as a whole can be overwhelming and difficult, therefore seperating into categories is beneficial as it might be easier to handle. Studying these chunks seperatly and determining how they relate to other parts is the basis os analysis. An important note is that analysis is done on data that has been collected in the past to explain why or how something happened.

Analytics on the other hand, is the the exploration of future events. When applying logical and computational reasoning to the outcomes of an analysis. This process looks for patterns that can be used to predict future behaviour. There are two types of analytics: qualitative, which combines the use of experience and outcomes of analysis to plan the next buisness move; and quantitative, which applies algorithms on the outcomes of the analysis.
